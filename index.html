Whether it’s to meet up with a friend around the block or video chat with a loved one across the world, your smartphone is there for you—except when it’s not. When your battery dies, so do those connections. Have you ever tried to surf the web or download a new app on a dead phone? No? Yea, doesn’t work for us either. We’re here to defend your mobile usage habits by providing smartphone charging that keeps up with the pace of you, making battery power an afterthought.</small></p>
                    <p><small>Currently expanding in NYC, our smartphone “charge-sharing” network consists of a squadron of Hoplite Hubs located in various businesses all around the city. These proprietary Hoplite Hubs store, dispense, and automatically recharge Hoplites, which are ergonomically-designed, universal battery packs that can be rented from and returned to any Hub in the network. With Hoplite Power, you can easily charge your smartphone on the go—no wires or outlets required! We keep your power protected so you always stay connected.</small></p>
